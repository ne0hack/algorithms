# 2239. Find Closest Number to Zero


## Description
Given an integer array `nums` of size `n`, return *the number with the value **closest** to *`0`* in *`nums`. If there are multiple answers, return *the number with the **largest** value*.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [-4,-2,1,4,8]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The distance from -4 to 0 is |-4| = 4.
The distance from -2 to 0 is |-2| = 2.
The distance from 1 to 0 is |1| = 1.
The distance from 4 to 0 is |4| = 4.
The distance from 8 to 0 is |8| = 8.
Thus, the closest number to 0 in the array is 1.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [2,-1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 and -1 are both the closest numbers to 0, so 1 being larger is returned.
```

#### Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 1000
- -10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def findClosestNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        result = [nums[0], abs(nums[0] - 0)]
        for num in nums[1:]:
            close = abs(num - 0)
            if close < result[1]:
                result = [num, close]
            elif close == result[1]:
                result[0] = max(num, result[0])
        return result[0]
```
