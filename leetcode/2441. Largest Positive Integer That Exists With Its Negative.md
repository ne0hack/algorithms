# 2441. Largest Positive Integer That Exists With Its Negative

## Description
Given an integer array `nums` that **does not contain** any zeros, find **the largest positive** integer `k` such that `-k` also exists in the array.

Return *the positive integer* `k`. If there is no such integer, return `-1`.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [-1,2,-3,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the only valid k we can find in the array.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [-1,10,6,7,-7,1]
Output: 7
Explanation: Both 1 and 7 have their corresponding negative values in the array. 7 has a larger value.
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [-10,8,6,7,-2,-3]
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no a single valid k, we return -1.
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxK(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        for i in sorted(nums, reverse=True):
            if i < 0:
                break
            if -i in nums:
                return i
        return -1
```
