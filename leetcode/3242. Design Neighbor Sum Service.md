# 3242. Design Neighbor Sum Service


## Description
You are given a `n x n` 2D array `grid` containing **distinct** elements in the range `[0, n^2 - 1]`.

Implement the `neighborSum` class:

-   `neighborSum(int [][]grid)` initializes the object.
-   `int adjacentSum(int value)` returns the **sum** of elements which are adjacent neighbors of `value`, that is either to the top, left, right, or bottom of `value` in `grid`.
-   `int diagonalSum(int value)` returns the **sum** of elements which are diagonal neighbors of `value`, that is either to the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, or bottom-right of `value` in `grid`.

#### Example 1:
```
Input:

["neighborSum", "adjacentSum", "adjacentSum", "diagonalSum", "diagonalSum"]

[[[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8]]], [1], [4], [4], [8]]

Output: [null, 6, 16, 16, 4]

Explanation:

The adjacent neighbors of 1 are 0, 2, and 4.
The adjacent neighbors of 4 are 1, 3, 5, and 7.
The diagonal neighbors of 4 are 0, 2, 6, and 8.
The diagonal neighbor of 8 is 4.
```

#### Example 1:
```
Input:

["neighborSum", "adjacentSum", "diagonalSum"]

[[[[1, 2, 0, 3], [4, 7, 15, 6], [8, 9, 10, 11], [12, 13, 14, 5]]], [15], [9]]

Output: [null, 23, 45]

Explanation:

The adjacent neighbors of 15 are 0, 10, 7, and 6.
The diagonal neighbors of 9 are 4, 12, 14, and 15.
```

#### Constraints:
- 3 <= n == grid.length == grid[0].length <= 10
- 0 <= grid[i][j] <= n^2 - 1
- All grid[i][j] are distinct.
- value in adjacentSum and diagonalSum will be in the range [0, n^2 - 1].
- At most 2 * n^2 calls will be made to adjacentSum and diagonalSum.


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class neighborSum:
    def __init__(self, grid: List[List[int]]):
        self.indxs = {}
        self.grid = grid
        for row in range(len(grid)):
            for col in range(len(grid[0])):
                self.indxs[grid[row][col]] = (row, col)
        
    def adjacentSum(self, value: int) -> int:
        row, col = self.indxs[value]
        value = 0
        if row != 0:
            value += self.grid[row-1][col]
        if row != len(self.grid)-1:
            value += self.grid[row+1][col]
        if col != 0:
            value += self.grid[row][col-1]
        if col != len(self.grid[0])-1:
            value += self.grid[row][col+1]
        
        return value

    def diagonalSum(self, value: int) -> int:
        row, col = self.indxs[value]
        value = 0
        if row != 0:
            if col != 0:
                value += self.grid[row-1][col-1]
            if col != len(self.grid[0])-1:
                value += self.grid[row-1][col+1]
        if row != len(self.grid)-1:
            if col != 0:
                value += self.grid[row+1][col-1]
            if col != len(self.grid[0])-1:
                value += self.grid[row+1][col+1]   
        
        return value
        


# Your neighborSum object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = neighborSum(grid)
# param_1 = obj.adjacentSum(value)
# param_2 = obj.diagonalSum(value)
```
