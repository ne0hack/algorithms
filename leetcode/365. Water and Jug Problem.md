# 365. Water and Jug Problem


## Description
You are given two jugs with capacities `jug1Capacity` and `jug2Capacity` liters. There is an infinite amount of water supply available. Determine whether it is possible to measure exactly `targetCapacity` liters using these two jugs.

If `targetCapacity` liters of water are measurable, you must have `targetCapacity`liters of water contained **within one or both buckets** by the end.

Operations allowed:

-   Fill any of the jugs with water.
-   Empty any of the jugs.
-   Pour water from one jug into another till the other jug is completely full, or the first jug itself is empty.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: jug1Capacity = 3, jug2Capacity = 5, targetCapacity = 4
Output: true
Explanation: The famous Die Hard example 
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: jug1Capacity = 2, jug2Capacity = 6, targetCapacity = 5
Output: false
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: jug1Capacity = 1, jug2Capacity = 2, targetCapacity = 3
Output: true
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def canMeasureWater(self, jug1Capacity: int, jug2Capacity: int, targetCapacity: int) -> bool:
        checked = set()

        def helper(n=0):
            if n < 0 or n > (jug1Capacity + jug2Capacity) or n in checked:
                return False
            elif n == targetCapacity:
                return True
            else:
                checked.add(n)
                return helper(n-jug1Capacity) or\
                       helper(n-jug2Capacity) or\
                       helper(n+jug1Capacity) or\
                       helper(n+jug2Capacity)
        
        return helper()
```
