# 3127. Make a Square with the Same Color


## Description
You are given a 2D matrix `grid` of size `3 x 3` consisting only of characters `'B'` and `'W'`. Character `'W'` represents the white color, and character `'B'` represents the black color.

Your task is to change the color of **at most one** cell so that the matrix has a `2 x 2` square where all cells are of the same color.

Return `true` if it is possible to create a `2 x 2` square of the same color, otherwise, return `false`.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: grid = [["B","W","B"],["B","W","W"],["B","W","B"]]

Output: true

Explanation:

It can be done by changing the color of the grid[0][2].
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: grid = [["B","W","B"],["W","B","W"],["B","W","B"]]

Output: false

Explanation:

It cannot be done by changing at most one cell.
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: grid = [["B","W","B"],["B","W","W"],["B","W","W"]]

Output: true

Explanation:

The grid already contains a 2 x 2 square of the same color.
```

#### Constraints:
- grid.length == 3
- grid[i].length == 3
- grid[i][j] is either 'W' or 'B'.


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def canMakeSquare(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> bool:
        for row in range(1, 3):
            for col in range(1, 3):
                cnt = defaultdict(int)
                cnt[grid[row][col]] += 1
                cnt[grid[row-1][col]] += 1
                cnt[grid[row-1][col-1]] += 1
                cnt[grid[row][col-1]] += 1
                if cnt.get("W", 0) >= 3 or cnt.get("B", 0) >= 3:
                    return True
        return False
```
