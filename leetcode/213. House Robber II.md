# 213. House Robber II

## Description
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return *the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police***.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 3
```


## Solution

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        if n < 3: 
            return max(nums)
        
        dp1 = [0] + nums[1:3] + [0] * (n-3)
        dp2[1] = max(nums[1], nums[2])
        for i in range(3, n):
            dp1[i] = max((max(dp1[i-2], dp1[i-3]) + nums[i]), dp1[i-1])

        dp2 = nums[0:2] + [0] * (n-3)
        dp2[1] = max(nums[1], nums[2])
        for i in range(2, n-1):
            dp2[i] = max((max(dp2[i-2], dp2[i-3]) + nums[i]), dp2[i-1])
        
        print(dp1)
        print(dp2)

        return max(dp1[-1], dp2[-1])
```
