# 2816. Double a Number Represented as a Linked List


## Description
You are given the `head` of a **non-empty** linked list representing a non-negative integer without leading zeroes.

Return *the *`head`* of the linked list after **doubling** it*.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: head = [1,8,9]
Output: [3,7,8]
Explanation: The figure above corresponds to the given linked list which represents the number 189. Hence, the returned linked list represents the number 189 * 2 = 378.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: head = [9,9,9]
Output: [1,9,9,8]
Explanation: The figure above corresponds to the given linked list which represents the number 999. Hence, the returned linked list reprersents the number 999 * 2 = 1998. 
```

#### Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 10^4]
- 0 <= Node.val <= 9
- The input is generated such that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros, except the number 0 itself.


## Solution

### Python3
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def doubleIt(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        num = []
        while head:
            num.append(head.val)
            head = head.next
        
        double = []
        remain = 0
        for n in num[::-1]:
            n = n * 2
            double.append(n % 10 + remain)
            remain = n // 10
        if remain:
            double.append(remain)
        
        result = ListNode()
        tail = result
        for n in double[::-1]:
            tail.next = ListNode(n)
            tail = tail.next

        return result.next
```
