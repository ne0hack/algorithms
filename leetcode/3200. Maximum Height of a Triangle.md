# 3200. Maximum Height of a Triangle


## Description
You are given two integers `red` and `blue` representing the count of red and blue colored balls. You have to arrange these balls to form a triangle such that the 1st row will have 1 ball, the 2nd row will have 2 balls, the 3rd row will have 3 balls, and so on.

All the balls in a particular row should be the **same** color, and adjacent rows should have **different**colors.

Return the **maximum** height of the triangle that can be achieved.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: red = 2, blue = 4

Output: 3
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: red = 2, blue = 1

Output: 2
```

#### Examle 3:
```
Input: red = 1, blue = 1

Output: 1
```

#### Example 4:
```
Input: red = 10, blue = 1

Output: 2
```


#### Constraints:
- 1 <= red, blue <= 100


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def maxHeightOfTriangle(self, red: int, blue: int) -> int:
        def helper(curr, nxt, res = 0, row = 1):
            if curr < row:
                return res            
            return helper(nxt, curr-row, res+1, row+1)
        
        return max(helper(red, blue), helper(blue, red))
```
