# 1123. Lowest Common Ancestor of Deepest Leaves


## Description
Given the `root` of a binary tree, return *the lowest common ancestor of its deepest leaves*.

Recall that:

-   The node of a binary tree is a leaf if and only if it has no children
-   The depth of the root of the tree is `0`. if the depth of a node is `d`, the depth of each of its children is `d + 1`.
-   The lowest common ancestor of a set `S` of nodes, is the node `A` with the largest depth such that every node in `S` is in the subtree with root `A`.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]
Output: [2,7,4]
Explanation: We return the node with value 2, colored in yellow in the diagram.
The nodes coloured in blue are the deepest leaf-nodes of the tree.
Note that nodes 6, 0, and 8 are also leaf nodes, but the depth of them is 2, but the depth of nodes 7 and 4 is 3.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
Explanation: The root is the deepest node in the tree, and it's the lca of itself.
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: root = [0,1,3,null,2]
Output: [2]
Explanation: The deepest leaf node in the tree is 2, the lca of one node is itself.
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def lcaDeepestLeaves(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        def helper(root, lvl=0):
            if root.left is None and root.right is None:
                return (lvl, root)
            if not root.left:
                return helper(root.right, lvl+1)
            elif not root.right:
                return helper(root.left, lvl+1)
            else:
                left_lvl, left_val = helper(root.left, lvl+1)
                right_lvl, right_val = helper(root.right, lvl+1)
                if left_lvl == right_lvl:
                    return left_lvl, root
                elif left_lvl > right_lvl:
                    return left_lvl, left_val
                elif left_lvl < right_lvl:
                    return right_lvl, right_val

        return helper(root)[1]
```
