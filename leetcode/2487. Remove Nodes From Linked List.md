# 2487. Remove Nodes From Linked List


## Description
You are given the `head` of a linked list.

Remove every node which has a node with a greater value anywhere to the right side of it.

Return *the *`head`* of the modified linked list.*

#### Example 1:
```
Input: head = [5,2,13,3,8]
Output: [13,8]
Explanation: The nodes that should be removed are 5, 2 and 3.
- Node 13 is to the right of node 5.
- Node 13 is to the right of node 2.
- Node 8 is to the right of node 3.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: head = [1,1,1,1]
Output: [1,1,1,1]
Explanation: Every node has value 1, so no nodes are removed.
```

#### Constraints:
- The number of the nodes in the given list is in the range [1, 10^5].
- 1 <= Node.val <= 10^5


## Solution

### Python3
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeNodes(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        que = []
        nodes = []
        while head:
            nodes.append(head.val)
            head = head.next

        for node in nodes[::-1]:
            if (not que) or (que[-1] <= node):
                que.append(node)
        
        result = ListNode()
        tail = result
        for node in que[::-1]:
            tail.next = ListNode(node)
            tail = tail.next

        return result.next
```
