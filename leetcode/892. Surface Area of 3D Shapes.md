# 892. Surface Area of 3D Shapes


## Description
You are given an `n x n` `grid` where you have placed some `1 x 1 x 1` cubes. Each value `v = grid[i][j]` represents a tower of `v` cubes placed on top of cell `(i, j)`.

After placing these cubes, you have decided to glue any directly adjacent cubes to each other, forming several irregular 3D shapes.

Return *the total surface area of the resulting shapes*.

**Note:** The bottom face of each shape counts toward its surface area.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: grid = [[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: 34
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
Output: 32
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: grid = [[2,2,2],[2,1,2],[2,2,2]]
Output: 46
```

#### Constraints:
- n == grid.length == grid[i].length
- 1 <= n <= 50
- 0 <= grid[i][j] <= 50


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def surfaceArea(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        area = 0
        fic = [[0] + [0]*len(grid) + [0]]
        grid = fic + [[0] + row + [0] for row in grid] + fic
        for row in range(1, len(grid)-1):
            for col in range(1, len(grid[0])-1):
                if grid[row][col]:
                    area += 2
                area += max(0, grid[row][col]-grid[row-1][col])
                area += max(0, grid[row][col]-grid[row+1][col])
                area += max(0, grid[row][col]-grid[row][col-1])
                area += max(0, grid[row][col]-grid[row][col+1])
        return area
```
