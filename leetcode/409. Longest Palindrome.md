# 409. Longest Palindrome

## Description
Given a string `s` which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return *the length of the **longest palindrome*** that can be built with those letters.

Letters are **case sensitive**, for example, `"Aa"` is not considered a palindrome here.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abccccdd"
Output: 7
Explanation: One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "a"
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest palindrome that can be built is "a", whose length is 1.
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> int:
        res, first = 0, True
        for i, v in Counter(list(s)).items():
            if v % 2 == 0:
                res += v
            else:
                if first:
                    res += v
                    first = False
                else:
                    res += v-1
        return res
```
