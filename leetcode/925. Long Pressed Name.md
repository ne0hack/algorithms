# 925. Long Pressed Name


## Description
Your friend is typing his `name` into a keyboard. Sometimes, when typing a character `c`, the key might get *long pressed*, and the character will be typed 1 or more times.

You examine the `typed` characters of the keyboard. Return `True` if it is possible that it was your friends name, with some characters (possibly none) being long pressed.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: name = "alex", typed = "aaleex"
Output: true
Explanation: 'a' and 'e' in 'alex' were long pressed.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: name = "saeed", typed = "ssaaedd"
Output: false
Explanation: 'e' must have been pressed twice, but it was not in the typed output.
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def isLongPressedName(self, name: str, typed: str) -> bool:
        name = list(name)
        typed = list(typed)
        while name and typed:
            temp_name = name.pop(0)
            for i in name.copy():
                if i not in temp_name:
                    break
                temp_name += name.pop(0)

            temp_typed = typed.pop(0)
            for i in typed.copy():
                if i not in temp_typed:
                    break
                temp_typed += typed.pop(0)

            if len(temp_typed) < len(temp_name) or set(temp_typed) != set(temp_name):
                return False
        if typed or name:
            return False
        return True
```
