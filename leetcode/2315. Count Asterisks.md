# 2315. Count Asterisks

## Description
You are given a string `s`, where every **two** consecutive vertical bars `'|'` are grouped into a **pair**. In other words, the 1st and 2nd `'|'` make a pair, the 3rd and 4th `'|'` make a pair, and so forth.

Return *the number of* `'*'` *in* `s`*, **excluding** the* `'*'` *between each pair of* `'|'`.

**Note** that each `'|'` will belong to **exactly** one pair.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "l|*e*et|co|*de|"
Output: 2
Explanation: The considered characters are underlined: "l|*e*et|c\*\*o|*de|".
The characters between the first and second '|' are excluded from the answer.
Also, the characters between the third and fourth '|' are excluded from the answer.
There are 2 asterisks considered. Therefore, we return 2.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "iamprogrammer"
Output: 0
Explanation: In this example, there are no asterisks in s. Therefore, we return 0.
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: s = "yo|uar|e|b|e*au|tifu|l"
Output: 5
Explanation: The considered characters are underlined: "yo|uar|e\*\*|b|e\*\*\*au|tifu|l". There are 5 asterisks considered. Therefore, we return 5.
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def countAsterisks(self, s: str) -> int:
        ans = 0
        for i, v in enumerate(s.split("|")):
            ans += v.count("*") if i % 2 == 0 else 0
        
        return ans
            
```
