# 2284. Sender With Largest Word Count

## Description
You have a chat log of `n` messages. You are given two string arrays `messages` and `senders` where `messages[i]` is a **message** sent by `senders[i]`.

A **message** is list of **words** that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. The **word count** of a sender is the total number of **words** sent by the sender. Note that a sender may send more than one message.

Return *the sender with the **largest** word count*. If there is more than one sender with the largest word count, return *the one with the **lexicographically largest** name*.

**Note:**

* Uppercase letters come before lowercase letters in lexicographical order.
* `"Alice"` and `"alice"` are distinct.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: messages = ["Hello userTwooo","Hi userThree","Wonderful day Alice","Nice day userThree"], senders = ["Alice","userTwo","userThree","Alice"]
Output: "Alice"
Explanation: Alice sends a total of 2 + 3 = 5 words.
userTwo sends a total of 2 words.
userThree sends a total of 3 words.
Since Alice has the largest word count, we return "Alice".
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: messages = ["How is leetcode for everyone","Leetcode is useful for practice"], senders = ["Bob","Charlie"]
Output: "Charlie"
Explanation: Bob sends a total of 5 words.
Charlie sends a total of 5 words.
Since there is a tie for the largest word count, we return the sender with the lexicographically larger name, Charlie.
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def largestWordCount(self, messages: List[str], senders: List[str]) -> str:
        p = defaultdict(int)
        mw = 0
        for i in range(len(messages)):
            p[senders[i]] += len(messages[i].split())
            mw = max(mw, p[senders[i]])
        return sorted([i for i in p if p[i] == mw])[-1]
```
