# 1184. Distance Between Bus Stops


## Description
A bus has `n` stops numbered from `0` to `n - 1` that form a circle. We know the distance between all pairs of neighboring stops where `distance[i]` is the distance between the stops number `i` and `(i + 1) % n`.

The bus goes along both directions i.e. clockwise and counterclockwise.

Return the shortest distance between the given `start` and `destination` stops.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: distance = [1,2,3,4], start = 0, destination = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: Distance between 0 and 1 is 1 or 9, minimum is 1.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: distance = [1,2,3,4], start = 0, destination = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: Distance between 0 and 2 is 3 or 7, minimum is 3.
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: distance = [1,2,3,4], start = 0, destination = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: Distance between 0 and 3 is 6 or 4, minimum is 4.
```

#### Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 10^4
- distance.length == n
- 0 <= start, destination < n
- 0 <= distance[i] <= 10^4


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def distanceBetweenBusStops(self, distance: List[int], start: int, destination: int) -> int:
        distance = list(enumerate(distance))
        res, rev_res = 0, 0
        start_cnt = False
        for i, v in distance+distance:
            if i == start:
                start_cnt = True
            if start_cnt:
                if i == destination:
                    break
                res += v
        
        start_cnt = False
        for i, v in distance[::-1]+distance[::-1]:
            if start_cnt:
                rev_res += v
                if i == destination:
                    break
            if i == start:
                start_cnt = True

        return min(res, rev_res)
```
