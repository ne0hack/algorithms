# 1979. Find Greatest Common Divisor of Array

## Description
Given an integer array `nums`, return*the **greatest common divisor** of the smallest number and largest number in* `nums`.

The **greatest common divisor** of two numbers is the largest positive integer that evenly divides both numbers.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2,5,6,9,10]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The smallest number in nums is 2.
The largest number in nums is 10.
The greatest common divisor of 2 and 10 is 2.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [7,5,6,8,3]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The smallest number in nums is 3.
The largest number in nums is 8.
The greatest common divisor of 3 and 8 is 1.
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [3,3]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The smallest number in nums is 3.
The largest number in nums is 3.
The greatest common divisor of 3 and 3 is 3.
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def findGCD(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        gcd = 0
        for i in range(max(nums), 0, -1):
            gcd = i if max(nums) % i == 0 and min(nums) % i == 0 and i > gcd else gcd
        return gcd
```
