# 1171. Remove Zero Sum Consecutive Nodes from Linked List


## Description
Given the `head` of a linked list, we repeatedly delete consecutive sequences of nodes that sum to `0` until there are no such sequences.

After doing so, return the head of the final linked list.  You may return any such answer.

(Note that in the examples below, all sequences are serializations of `ListNode` objects.)

#### Example 1:
```
Input: head = [1,2,-3,3,1]
Output: [3,1]
Note: The answer [1,2,1] would also be accepted.
```

#### Exampe 2:
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,-3,4]
Output: [1,2,4]
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,-3,-2]
Output: [1]
```

#### Constraints:
- The given linked list will contain between 1 and 1000 nodes.
- Each node in the linked list has -1000 <= node.val <= 1000.


## Solution

### Python3
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeZeroSumSublists(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        nodes = []

        while head:
            nodes.append(head.val)
            head = head.next

        def helper(nodes):
            dq = []
            for i in nodes:
                if i != 0:
                    dq_copy = []
                    changed = False
                    while dq:
                        dq_copy.append(dq.pop(-1))
                        if sum(dq_copy) + i == 0:
                            changed = True
                            break
                    if not changed:
                        dq += dq_copy[::-1]
                        dq.append(i)
            return dq
        
        nodes = helper(nodes)
        nodes = helper(nodes[::-1])[::-1]
        
        result = ListNode()
        tail = result
        for i in nodes:
            tail.next = ListNode(i)
            tail = tail.next
        return result.next
```
