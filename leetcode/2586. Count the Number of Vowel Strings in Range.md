# 2586. Count the Number of Vowel Strings in Range

## Description
You are given a **0-indexed** array of string `words` and two integers `left` and `right`.

A string is called a **vowel string** if it starts with a vowel character and ends with a vowel character where vowel characters are `'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, and `'u'`.

Return *the number of vowel strings* `words[i]` *where* `i` *belongs to the inclusive range* `[left, right]`.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: words = ["are","amy","u"], left = 0, right = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 
- "are" is a vowel string because it starts with 'a' and ends with 'e'.
- "amy" is not a vowel string because it does not end with a vowel.
- "u" is a vowel string because it starts with 'u' and ends with 'u'.
The number of vowel strings in the mentioned range is 2.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: words = ["hey","aeo","mu","ooo","artro"], left = 1, right = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: 
- "aeo" is a vowel string because it starts with 'a' and ends with 'o'.
- "mu" is not a vowel string because it does not start with a vowel.
- "ooo" is a vowel string because it starts with 'o' and ends with 'o'.
- "artro" is a vowel string because it starts with 'a' and ends with 'o'.
The number of vowel strings in the mentioned range is 3.
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def vowelStrings(self, words: List[str], left: int, right: int) -> int:
        vowel_chars = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
        result = 0

        for word in words[left:right+1]:
            if word[0] in vowel_chars and word[-1] in vowel_chars:
                result += 1

        return result
```
