# 1758. Minimum Changes To Make Alternating Binary String


## Description
You are given a string `s` consisting only of the characters `'0'` and `'1'`. In one operation, you can change any `'0'` to `'1'` or vice versa.

The string is called alternating if no two adjacent characters are equal. For example, the string `"010"` is alternating, while the string `"0100"` is not.

Return *the **minimum** number of operations needed to make* `s` *alternating*.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "0100"
Output: 1
Explanation: If you change the last character to '1', s will be "0101", which is alternating.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "10"
Output: 0
Explanation: s is already alternating.
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: s = "1111"
Output: 2
Explanation: You need two operations to reach "0101" or "1010".
```

#### Constraints:
- 1 <= s.length <= 104
- s[i] is either '0' or '1'.


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, s: str) -> int:
        def helper(s: list) -> int:
            cnt = 0
            for i in range(1, len(s)):
                if s[i-1] == s[i]:
                    s[i] = "0" if s[i-1] == "1" else "1"
                    cnt += 1
            return cnt
        
        return min(helper(list(s)), helper([("1" if s[0] == "0" else "0")] + list(s[1:])) + 1)
```
