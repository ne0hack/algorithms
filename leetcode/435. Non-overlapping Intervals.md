# 435. Non-overlapping Intervals


## Description
Given an array of intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return *the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping*.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
```

#### Constraints:
- 1 <= intervals.length <= 10^5
- intervals[i].length == 2
- -5 * 10^4 <= start[i] < end[i] <= 5 * 10^4


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        '''
        time: O(n*log(n))
        space: O(n)
        '''
        result = 0
        intervals.sort()
        que = [intervals[0]]
  
        for start, end in intervals[1:]:
            prev_start, prev_end = que[-1]
            if start < prev_end and end < prev_end:
                que.pop()
                que.append([start, end])
                result += 1
            elif start >= prev_end:
                que.append([start, end])
            else:
                result += 1
        
        return result
```
