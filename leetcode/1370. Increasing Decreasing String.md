# 1370. Increasing Decreasing String


## Description
You are given a string `s`. Reorder the string using the following algorithm:

1.  Pick the **smallest** character from `s` and **append** it to the result.
2.  Pick the **smallest** character from `s` which is greater than the last appended character to the result and **append** it.
3.  Repeat step 2 until you cannot pick more characters.
4.  Pick the **largest** character from `s` and **append** it to the result.
5.  Pick the **largest** character from `s` which is smaller than the last appended character to the result and **append** it.
6.  Repeat step 5 until you cannot pick more characters.
7.  Repeat the steps from 1 to 6 until you pick all characters from `s`.

In each step, If the smallest or the largest character appears more than once you can choose any occurrence and append it to the result.

Return *the result string after sorting *`s`* with this algorithm*.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "aaaabbbbcccc"
Output: "abccbaabccba"
Explanation: After steps 1, 2 and 3 of the first iteration, result = "abc"
After steps 4, 5 and 6 of the first iteration, result = "abccba"
First iteration is done. Now s = "aabbcc" and we go back to step 1
After steps 1, 2 and 3 of the second iteration, result = "abccbaabc"
After steps 4, 5 and 6 of the second iteration, result = "abccbaabccba"
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "rat"
Output: "art"
Explanation: The word "rat" becomes "art" after re-ordering it with the mentioned algorithm.
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def sortString(self, s: str) -> str:
        result = []
        s = list(s)
        while s:
            step1 = min(s)
            result.append(step1)
            s.remove(step1)
            step2 = sorted(list(set(s)))
            if step1 in step2:
                step2.remove(step1)
            result += step2
            for i in step2:
                s.remove(i)
            if s:
                step4 = max(s)
                result.append(step4)
                s.remove(step4)
                step5 = sorted(list(set(s)), reverse=True)
                if step4 in step5:
                    step5.remove(step4)
                result += step5
                for i in step5:
                    s.remove(i)
        return "".join(result)
```
