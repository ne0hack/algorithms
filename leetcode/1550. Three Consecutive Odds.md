# 1550. Three Consecutive Odds


## Description
Given an integer array `arr`, return `true` if there are three consecutive odd numbers in the array. Otherwise, return `false`.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: arr = [2,6,4,1]
Output: false
Explanation: There are no three consecutive odds.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: arr = [1,2,34,3,4,5,7,23,12]
Output: true
Explanation: [5,7,23] are three consecutive odds.
```

#### Constraints:
- 1 <= arr.length <= 1000
- 1 <= arr[i] <= 1000


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def threeConsecutiveOdds(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        if len(arr) < 3: return False
        prev = (arr[0] % 2 != 0) & (arr[1] % 2 != 0)
        cnt = 2 if prev else 0
        for i in range(2, len(arr)):
            if arr[i] % 2 != 0:
                if prev and cnt == 2:
                        return True
                cnt += 1
                prev = True
            else:
                cnt = 0
                prev = False
        return False
```
