# 2341. Maximum Number of Pairs in Array


## Description
You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`. In one operation, you may do the following:

-   Choose **two** integers in `nums` that are **equal**.
-   Remove both integers from `nums`, forming a **pair**.

The operation is done on `nums` as many times as possible.

Return *a **0-indexed** integer array *`answer`* of size *`2`* where *`answer[0]`* is the number of pairs that are formed and *`answer[1]`* is the number of leftover integers in *`nums`* after doing the operation as many times as possible*.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,3,2,1,3,2,2]
Output: [3,1]
Explanation:
Form a pair with nums[0] and nums[3] and remove them from nums. Now, nums = [3,2,3,2,2].
Form a pair with nums[0] and nums[2] and remove them from nums. Now, nums = [2,2,2].
Form a pair with nums[0] and nums[1] and remove them from nums. Now, nums = [2].
No more pairs can be formed. A total of 3 pairs have been formed, and there is 1 number leftover in nums.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,1]
Output: [1,0]
Explanation: Form a pair with nums[0] and nums[1] and remove them from nums. Now, nums = [].
No more pairs can be formed. A total of 1 pair has been formed, and there are 0 numbers leftover in nums.
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: No pairs can be formed, and there is 1 number leftover in nums.
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfPairs(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        nums = Counter(nums)
        ans1, ans2 = 0, 0
        for i in nums:
            ans1 += nums[i] // 2
            if nums[i] % 2 != 0:
                ans2 += 1
        return [ans1, ans2]
```
