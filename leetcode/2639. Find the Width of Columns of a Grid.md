# 2639. Find the Width of Columns of a Grid

## Description
You are given a **0-indexed** `m x n` integer matrix `grid`. The width of a column is the maximum **length** of its integers.

* For example, if `grid = [[-10], [3], [12]]`, the width of the only column is `3` since `-10` is of length `3`.

Return *an integer array* `ans` *of size* `n` *where* `ans[i]` *is the width of the* `ith` *column*.

The **length** of an integer `x` with `len` digits is equal to `len` if `x` is non-negative, and `len + 1` otherwise.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: grid = [[1],[22],[333]]
Output: [3]
Explanation: In the 0th column, 333 is of length 3.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: grid = [[-15,1,3],[15,7,12],[5,6,-2]]
Output: [3,1,2]
Explanation: 
In the 0th column, only -15 is of length 3.
In the 1st column, all integers are of length 1. 
In the 2nd column, both 12 and -2 are of length 2.
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def findColumnWidth(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        gridR = [[0] * len(grid) for _ in range(len(grid[0]))]
        for x in range(len(grid)):
            for y in range(len(grid[x])):
                gridR[y][x] = len(str(grid[x][y]))
        return list(map(max, gridR))
```
