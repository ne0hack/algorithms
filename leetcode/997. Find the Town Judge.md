# 997. Find the Town Judge

## Description
In a town, there are `n` people labeled from `1` to `n`. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:

1. The town judge trusts nobody.
2. Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
3. There is exactly one person that satisfies properties **1** and **2**.

You are given an array `trust` where `trust[i] = [ai, bi]` representing that the person labeled `ai` trusts the person labeled `bi`. If a trust relationship does not exist in `trust` array, then such a trust relationship does not exist.

Return *the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return* `-1` *otherwise*.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
Output: 2
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 3
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: -1
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def findJudge(self, n: int, trust: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if n == 1: return 1
        judge = defaultdict(int)
        
        for i1, i2 in trust:
            judge[i1] -= 1
            judge[i2] += 1         
            
        j = sorted(judge, key=lambda x: judge[x], reverse=True)
        if j and judge[j[0]] == n-1:
            return j[0]
        return -1
```
