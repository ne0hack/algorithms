# 2405. Optimal Partition of String

## Description
Given a string `s`, partition the string into one or more **substrings** such that the characters in each substring are **unique**. That is, no letter appears in a single substring more than **once**.

Return *the **minimum** number of substrings in such a partition.*

Note that each character should belong to exactly one substring in a partition.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abacaba"
Output: 4
Explanation:
Two possible partitions are ("a","ba","cab","a") and ("ab","a","ca","ba").
It can be shown that 4 is the minimum number of substrings needed.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "ssssss"
Output: 6
Explanation:The only valid partition is ("s","s","s","s","s","s").
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def partitionString(self, s: str) -> int:
        res = []
        temp = ""
        for i in s+s[-1]:
            if i in temp:
                res.append(temp)
                temp = ""
            temp += i
        return len(res)
```
