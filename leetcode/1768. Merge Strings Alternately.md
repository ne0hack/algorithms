# 1768. Merge Strings Alternately

## Description
You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with `word1`. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return *the merged string.*

#### Example 1:
```
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b 
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
Output: "apbqcd"
Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b   c   d
word2:    p   q 
merged: a p b q c   d
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        z = 0
        word2 = list(word2)
        for i in range(len(word1)):
            word2.insert(i+z, word1[i])
            z += 1
        return "".join(word2)
```
