# 130. Surrounded Regions


## Description
Given an `m x n` matrix `board` containing `'X'` and `'O'`, *capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by* `'X'`.

A region is **captured** by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
Explanation: Notice that an 'O' should not be flipped if:
- It is on the border, or
- It is adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped.
The bottom 'O' is on the border, so it is not flipped.
The other three 'O' form a surrounded region, so they are flipped.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: board = [["X"]]
Output: [["X"]]
```

#### Constraints:
- m == board.length
- n == board[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 200
- board[i][j] is 'X' or 'O'.


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> None:
        """
        time: O(n * m)
        space: O(n * m)
        """

        noncap = set()

        def checker(row, col):
            if (row, col) in noncap or row >= len(board) or row < 0 or col >= len(board[0]) or col < 0 or board[row][col] == "X":
                return

            noncap.add((row, col))

            checker(row+1, col)
            checker(row-1, col)
            checker(row, col+1)
            checker(row, col-1)

        for row in [0, len(board)-1]:
            for col in range(len(board[0])):
                if board[row][col] == "O":
                    checker(row, col)
        
        for col in [0, len(board[0])-1]:
            for row in range(len(board)):
                if board[row][col] == "O":
                    checker(row, col)

        for row in range(len(board)):
            for col in range(len(board[0])):
                if board[row][col] == "O" and (row, col) not in noncap:
                    board[row][col] = "X"
```
