# 2206. Divide Array Into Equal Pairs

## Description
You are given an integer array `nums` consisting of `2 * n` integers.

You need to divide `nums` into `n` pairs such that:

* Each element belongs to **exactly one** pair.
* The elements present in a pair are **equal**.

Return `true` *if nums can be divided into* `n` *pairs, otherwise return* `false`.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [3,2,3,2,2,2]
Output: true
Explanation: 
There are 6 elements in nums, so they should be divided into 6 / 2 = 3 pairs.
If nums is divided into the pairs (2, 2), (3, 3), and (2, 2), it will satisfy all the conditions.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
Explanation: 
There is no way to divide nums into 4 / 2 = 2 pairs such that the pairs satisfy every condition.
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def divideArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        n = 0
        f = lambda A, n=2: [A[i:i+n] for i in range(0, len(A), n)]
        for i in f(sorted(nums)):
            if i[0] == i[1]:
                n += 1
        return len(nums)//2 == n
```
