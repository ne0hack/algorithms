# 2900. Longest Unequal Adjacent Groups Subsequence I


## Description
You are given a **binary** array `groups` of length `n`.

You need to select the **longest alternating** subsequence from `groups`. An alternating subsequence is a sequence of indices that for any two consecutive indices in it, their corresponding elements in the binary array `groups` are different. Essentially, you're picking indices where adjacent elements in the `groups` array are not the same.

Formally, you need to find the longest subsequence of an array of indices `[0, 1, ..., n - 1]`denoted as `[i0, i1, ..., ik-1]`, such that `groups[ij] != groups[ij+1]` for each `0 <= j < k - 1`.

Return *the selected subsequence. If there are multiple answers, return **any** of them.*

#### Example 1:
```
Input: groups = [0,0,1]

Output: [0,2]

Explanation: A subsequence that can be selected is [0,2] because groups[0] != groups[2]. Another subsequence that can be selected is [1,2] because groups[1] != groups[2]. It can be demonstrated that the length of the longest subsequence of indices that satisfies the condition is 2.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: groups = [1,0,1,1]

Output: [0,1,2]

Explanation: A subsequence that can be selected is [0,1,2] because groups[0] != groups[1] and groups[1] != groups[2]. Another subsequence that can be selected is [0,1,3] because groups[0] != groups[1] and groups[1] != groups[3]. It can be shown that the length of the longest subsequence of indices that satisfies the condition is 3.
```

#### Constraints:
- 1 <= n == groups.length <= 100
- groups[i] is either 0 or 1.


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def getLongestSubsequence(self, groups: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        if 1 not in groups or 0 not in groups: return [0]
        ones = [groups.index(1)]
        zeros = [groups.index(0)]

        for i, v in enumerate(groups):
            if i > ones[-1] and groups[ones[-1]] != v:
                ones.append(i)
            if i > zeros[-1] and groups[zeros[-1]] != v:
                zeros.append(i)

        return max(ones, zeros, key=len)
```
