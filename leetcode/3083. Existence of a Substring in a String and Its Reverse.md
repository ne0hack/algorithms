# 3083. Existence of a Substring in a String and Its Reverse


## Description
Given astring `s`, find any substring of length `2` which is also present in the reverse of `s`.

Return `true` *if such a substring exists, and *`false`* otherwise.*

#### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "leetcode"

Output: true

Explanation: Substring "ee" is of length 2 which is also present in reverse(s) == "edocteel".
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "abcba"

Output: true

Explanation: All of the substrings of length 2 "ab", "bc", "cb", "ba" are also present in reverse(s) == "abcba".
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: s = "abcd"

Output: false

Explanation: There is no substring of length 2 in s, which is also present in the reverse of s.
```

#### Constraints:
- 1 <= s.length <= 100
- s consists only of lowercase English letters.


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def isSubstringPresent(self, s: str) -> bool:
        '''
        time: O(n)
        space: O(n)
        '''
 
        rev_s = s[::-1]
        s_set, rev_s_set = set(), set()

        for i in range(len(s)-1):
            s_set.add(s[i:i+2])
        
        for i in range(len(rev_s)-1):
            rev_s_set.add(rev_s[i:i+2])
        
        # set_len_N & set_len_M = time: O(min(N, M))
        return len(s_set & rev_s_set) != 0
```
