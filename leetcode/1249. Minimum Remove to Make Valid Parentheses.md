# 1249. Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses

## Description
Given a string s of `'('` , `')'` and lowercase English characters.

Your task is to remove the minimum number of parentheses ( `'('` or `')'`, in any positions ) so that the resulting *parentheses string* is valid and return **any** valid string.

Formally, a *parentheses string* is valid if and only if:

* It is the empty string, contains only lowercase characters, or
* It can be written as `AB` (`A` concatenated with `B`), where `A` and `B` are valid strings, or
* It can be written as `(A)`, where `A` is a valid string.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "lee(t(c)o)de)"
Output: "lee(t(c)o)de"
Explanation: "lee(t(co)de)" , "lee(t(c)ode)" would also be accepted.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "a)b(c)d"
Output: "ab(c)d"
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: s = "))(("
Output: ""
Explanation: An empty string is also valid.
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def minRemoveToMakeValid(self, s: str) -> str:
        que, res = [], ""

        for i, v in enumerate(s):
            if que and v == ")" and s[que[-1]] == "(":
                que.pop()
            elif v in "()":
                que.append(i)
        
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if i not in que:
                res += s[i]
        
        return res
```
