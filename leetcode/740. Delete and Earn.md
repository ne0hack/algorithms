# 740. Delete and Earn

## Description
You are given an integer array `nums`. You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:

* Pick any `nums[i]` and delete it to earn `nums[i]` points. Afterwards, you must delete **every** element equal to `nums[i] - 1` and **every** element equal to `nums[i] + 1`.

Return *the **maximum number of points** you can earn by applying the above operation some number of times*.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [3,4,2]
Output: 6
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete 4 to earn 4 points. Consequently, 3 is also deleted. nums = [2].
- Delete 2 to earn 2 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 6 points.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [2,2,3,3,3,4]
Output: 9
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete a 3 to earn 3 points. All 2's and 4's are also deleted. nums = [3,3].
- Delete a 3 again to earn 3 points. nums = [3].
- Delete a 3 once more to earn 3 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 9 points.
```


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def deleteAndEarn(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums = Counter(nums)
        keys = sorted(nums)
        res = [0] * len(keys)

        for i in range(len(keys)):
            if i == 0:
                res[i] = keys[i] * nums[keys[i]]
            elif i == 1:
                if keys[i-1] != keys[i]-1:
                    res[i] = res[i-1] + keys[i] * nums[keys[i]]
                else:
                    res[i] = max(res[i-1], keys[i] * nums[keys[i]])
            else:
                if keys[i-1] != keys[i]-1:
                    res[i] = res[i-1] + keys[i] * nums[keys[i]]
                else:
                    res[i] = max(res[i-1], res[i-2] + keys[i] * nums[keys[i]])

        return max(res)
