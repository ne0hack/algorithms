# 717. 1-bit and 2-bit Characters


## Description
We have two special characters:

-   The first character can be represented by one bit `0`.
-   The second character can be represented by two bits (`10` or `11`).

Given a binary array `bits` that ends with `0`, return `true` if the last character must be a one-bit character.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: bits = [1,0,0]
Output: true
Explanation: The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character.
So the last character is one-bit character.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: bits = [1,1,1,0]
Output: false
Explanation: The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character.
So the last character is not one-bit character.
```

#### Constraints:
- 1 <= bits.length <= 1000
- bits[i] is either 0 or 1.


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def isOneBitCharacter(self, bits: List[int]) -> bool:
        z = 0
        while z < len(bits)-1:
            z += 1 if bits[z] == 0 else 2
        return z == len(bits)-1
```
