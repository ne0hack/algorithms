# 3216. Lexicographically Smallest String After a Swap


## Description
Given a string `s` containing only digits, return the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained after swapping **adjacent** digits in `s` with the same **parity** at most **once**.

Digits have the same parity if both are odd or both are even. For example, 5 and 9, as well as 2 and 4, have the same parity, while 6 and 9 do not.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "45320"

Output: "43520"

Explanation:

s[1] == '5' and s[2] == '3' both have the same parity, and swapping them results in the lexicographically smallest string.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "001"

Output: "001"

Explanation:

There is no need to perform a swap because s is already the lexicographically smallest.
```

#### Constraints:
- 2 <= s.length <= 100
- s consists only of digits.


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def getSmallestString(self, s: str) -> str:
        s = list(s)
        for i in range(len(s)-1):
            a = int(s[i])
            b = int(s[i+1])
            if a > b and ((a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0) or (a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0)):
                s[i], s[i+1] = s[i+1], s[i]
                break
        return "".join(s)
```
