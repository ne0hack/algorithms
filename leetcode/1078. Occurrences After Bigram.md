# 1078. Occurrences After Bigram


## Description
Given two strings `first` and `second`, consider occurrences in some text of the form `"first second third"`, where `second` comes immediately after `first`, and `third` comes immediately after `second`.

Return *an array of all the words* `third` *for each occurrence of* `"first second third"`.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: text = "alice is a good girl she is a good student", first = "a", second = "good"
Output: ["girl","student"]
```

#### Example 2:
```

- text consists of lowercase English letters and spaces.
- All the words in text a separated by a single space.
- 1 <= first.length, second.length <= 10
- first and second consist of lowercase English letters.


## Solution

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def findOcurrences(self, text: str, first: str, second: str) -> List[str]:
        result = []
        text = text.split()
        for a, b, c in zip(text[:-2], text[1:], text[2:]):
            if (a, b) == (first, second):
                result.append(c)
        return result
```
