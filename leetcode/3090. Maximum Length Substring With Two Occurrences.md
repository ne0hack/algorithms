# 3090. Maximum Length Substring With Two Occurrences


## Description
Given a string `s`, return the **maximum** length of a substring such that it contains *at most two occurrences* of each character.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "bcbbbcba"

Output: 4

Explanation:

The following substring has a length of 4 and contains at most two occurrences of each character: "bcbbbcba".
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "aaaa"

Output: 2

Explanation:

The following substring has a length of 2 and contains at most two occurrences of each character: "aaaa".
```

#### Constraints:
- 2 <= s.length <= 100
- s consists only of lowercase English letters.


## Solution

### Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def maximumLengthSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        '''
        time: O(n)
        space: O(n)
        '''
        result = 0
        hmap = defaultdict(list)
        l, r = 0, 0

        while r < len(s):
            hmap[s[r]].append(r)

            if len(hmap[s[r]]) > 2:
                result = max(result, r-l)
                prev_l = l
                l = hmap[s[r]][0]+1
                for i in range(prev_l, l):
                    hmap[s[i]].pop(0)

            r += 1
 
        return max(result, r-l)
```
