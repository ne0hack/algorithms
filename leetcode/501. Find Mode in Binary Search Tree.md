# 501. Find Mode in Binary Search Tree


## Description
Given the `root` of a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, return *all the [mode(s)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics)) (i.e., the most frequently occurred element) in it*.

If the tree has more than one mode, return them in **any order**.

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

-   The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than or equal to** the node's key.
-   The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than or equal to** the node's key.
-   Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: root = [1,null,2,2]
Output: [2]
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: root = [0]
Output: [0]
```

#### Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
- -10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5


## Solution

### Python3
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def findMode(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:
        counter = defaultdict(int)

        def helper(root):
            if not root:
                return
            counter[root.val] += 1
            helper(root.right)
            helper(root.left)
        
        helper(root)
        max_num = counter[max(counter, key=lambda x: counter[x])]
        return [num for num in counter if counter[num] == max_num]
```
