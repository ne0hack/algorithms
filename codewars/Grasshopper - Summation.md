# Grasshopper - Summation


## Description
Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0. Your function only needs to return the result, what is shown between parentheses in the example below is how you reach that result and it's not part of it, see the sample tests.

For exampleÂ **(Input -> Output)**:

```
2 -> 3 (1 + 2)
8 -> 36 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8)
```


## Sample Tests
```python
import codewars_test as test
from solution import summation

@test.describe('Fixed tests')
def basic_tests():
    @test.it('Basic Test Cases')
    def basic_test_cases():
        test.assert_equals(summation(1), 1)
        test.assert_equals(summation(8), 36)
        test.assert_equals(summation(22), 253)
        test.assert_equals(summation(100), 5050)
        test.assert_equals(summation(213), 22791)
```


## Solution
### Python3
```python
def summation(num):
    return sum([i for i in range(1, num+1)])
```
